# Runtime dependencies for ReNight
# Python baseline: 3.11
#
# Notes:
# - PySide6 is the only runtime dependency. It pulls in shiboken6 and the
#   Essentials/Addons wheels automatically, so those should not be listed here.
# - Build tooling (e.g. Nuitka, PyInstaller) is intentionally not included.

PySide6>=6.6,<7
